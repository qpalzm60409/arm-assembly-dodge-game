; 1.1.2.2
; This scatterloading descriptor file defines:
; one load region (FLASH) and 3 execution regions
; (FLASH, SSRAM & SRAM)
;
; The FLASH resides at 0x04000000.
; On reset, an aliased copy of FLASH is re-mapped (by hardware) 
; to address zero.  Following reset, SSRAM is mapped to
; address zero, by the first few instructions in boot.s.
;
; The SSRAM area might be fast on-chip (internal) RAM, and is
; typically used for the stack and code that must be executed quickly.
; Here, the exception vectors (in vectors.s) and interrupt handler
; (in C_int_handler.c) get relocated (copied) from FLASH to (fast)
; SSRAM at address 0x000 for speed.
;
; SRAM might be slower off-chip (external) DRAM, and is typically
; used for less frequently accessed RW variables and ZI data.  
; Here, the RW variables and ZI data of the main program code
; (in C_main.c) get copied/initialised in SRAM at address 0x2000.
;
; All other read-only code '* (+RO)' i.e. regioninit, main program
; and library code is executed from FLASH
