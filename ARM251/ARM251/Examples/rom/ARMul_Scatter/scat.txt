; This scatterloading descriptor file defines:
; one load region (FLASH) and 3 execution regions
; (FLASH, 32bitRAM & 16bitRAM)
;
; The FLASH resides at 0x04000000.
; On reset, an aliased copy of FLASH is re-mapped (by hardware) 
; to address zero.  Following reset, 32bitRAM is mapped to
; address zero, by the first few instructions in boot.s.
;
; 32bitRAM might be fast on-chip (internal) RAM, and is typically
; used for the stack and code that must be executed quickly.
; Here, the exception vectors of vectors.s get relocated (copied) 
; from FLASH to 32bitRAM.
;
; 16bitRAM might be slower off-chip (external) DRAM, and is 
; typically used for less frequently accessed RW variables and 
; ZI data.  Here, the RW & ZI areas of C_main & C_func get 
; relocated/initialised to 16bitRAM
;
; All other read-only code '* (+RO)' i.e. regioninit & library 
; code is executed from FLASH
