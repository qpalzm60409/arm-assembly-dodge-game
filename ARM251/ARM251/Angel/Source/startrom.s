        ; Notes:
        ; To make it simpler for the developer to understand, the ROM
        ; specific and generic Angel workspace are provided as
        ; standard RW data AREAs.
        ;
        ; However, this means that care must be taken when
        ; constructing ROM based versions of Angel. In fact there are
        ; two types of ROM based Angel: boot ROMs and application
        ; ROMs. For application ROMs we do not need to worry about the
        ; size of RW data, since *NO* programs will be downloaded, and
        ; the application can use as much RAM as required. However,
        ; for boot ROMs we need to ensure that the RAM usage of the
        ; ROM system does not exceed 0x8000. This will ensure that
        ; default AIF applications can be downloaded.
        ;
        ; For non-ROM based applications the linker can be left to
        ; place data AREAs as it sees fit. For ROM based code we force
        ; the linker to reference the data at a fixed address. The
        ; only problem then becomes finding the initialised data in
        ; the ROM image, and ensuring that it is copied to the correct
        ; RAM address. This can be achieved as follows:
        ;
        ; 1) We know that the linker places identical area types
        ;    contiguously.
        ;
        ; 2) We explicitly force the RO (code areas) to be at the
        ;    start of the ROM image.
        ;
        ; 3) We can use Image$$RO$$Base and Limit to find the end of
        ;    the RO section in the ROM image. This will give us the start
        ;    location in the ROM of the RW data.
        ;
        ; 4) We can use the corresponding RW and ZI Base and Limit
        ;    values to find out how big the areas are, and initialise the
        ;    RAM accordingly.
        ;
        ; 5) Since we now know how large the RW data is, we can find
        ;    the end of the ROM image and any post-armlink information
        ;    that has been appended to the binary image (e.g. CRCs, MMU
        ;    tables, etc.).
        ;
        ; 6) We know that the linker places R/W code areas before R/W
        ;    data areas, which in turn appear before the BSS areas.
        ;
        ; We cannot use the "-last" feature of the ARM linker to place
        ; a RO area at the end, since this will break point 1) where
        ; the linker wants to make AREAs of the same type contiguous.
