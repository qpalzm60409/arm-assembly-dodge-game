 * the debug-hardware module, whilst O/S specific messages are passed

 * those functions. The vectoring code can then check for these, and
 * perform suitable error message generation if there is no handler.
 *
 * This is better than having a lot of conditionals in the 'C' source,
 * since now all that is required to remove handler functions is
 * simply to build an Angel with the relevant object files (or AREAs)
